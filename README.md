## Hi to everybody! 👋

I'm Jose R. Prieto, and i'm work as Software Architect, DevOp Architect, Solutions Architect, and Tech Leader.

I like to be an "evangelist" of best IT practices; SOLID, KISS, YAGNI, Clean code, design patterns, clean architecture.. Automation, pipelines, isolation, inmutability, o11y, relability, and so on..

I've work on IT from 1999; yeah, a few years.. With a lot of coleagues, companies (clients, partners, contractors), technologies, tools.. A lot of histories to tell us 😅🙈💪🏼

### Current stack

I worked with a lot of tools, languages, and stacks, over the years; but, right now, you can see mi current stack here (thanks to stackshare.io!):

### 👷 Check out what I'm currently working on

I'm working on [Avincis](https://avincis.com), on the Spanish I+D+i Department, as a DevOp & Solutions Architect; we're working on a fantastic and more exciting project for get information in real time, manage, and operate, on critical missions, like fires, critical rescues, and so on; with aerial vehicles; tripulated and no tripulated (yes, UAV too).

I'm dealing with the infrastructure asociate to the various lines of the projects, and try tha "everything works fine" all the time.

And, i try to automate **everything** on our tools and on our develop methods, and for our developers.. More or less; but, we are yet on the road 😥

My approach is follow the Platform Engineering practices, that is good for developers, and good for Ops, because if we have success applying these techniques, we would have a lot of control of the releases and the solutions releases to our production environments; and all of this they will be transparent for our developers, and that will be very good, grateful, and great for all of us.

### 🌱 My latest professional projects / jobs

I hope than we can tell you very much of the projects that we are working on Avincis I+D+i, and put here some public links to more information of these projects; for the moment, you have to stay tunned.. I'm so sorry 🙏🏼
